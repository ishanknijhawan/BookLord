<h3><center>Title: BookLord</center></h3>

The need of buying a brand new book is decreasing day by day as people studying for a college semester or those who are preparing for competitive exams donâ€™t need books for that long. Some avid readers just want a book for few weeks and return them instead of purchasing it. Booklord is a mobile app which helps people buy, sell or rent used books online. 

People who buy new books find it difficult to sell it for a good price. They either ending up giving up their books to newspaper sellers to free up space in their cupboard, or sell them at a local stationery shop at a really low price.
Furthermore, those people who are looking for used books have no choice but to go to stationery shops where the shopkeeper sells those used books at a very high price.

Booklord considers the above situations and allows one on one interaction between buyer and seller without any intermediary. People can sell their used books at the price they find it reasonable and those who are looking for a used book have a variety of options to choose from, based upon book condition, price and seller location.
Through this app, we try to ease up the process of buying or selling a used book by moving the whole process online. People can browse books, sort them by price, or distance. And once they want to purchase it, they can directly chat with the buyers for further details.



## About the product

The app is made in Flutter, which is to say that it can work in both Android and iOS with one single codebase. I was only able to test it with an Android device because I don't have a Mac machine, but it will work on any iOS device just as good. For backend I've used Firebase, technically below mentioned Firebase tools

- **FirebaseAuth** for authentication and Google Sign in
- **FirebaseStorage** for storing user's profile pictures, image messages in chats and images of user's posted ads
- Firebase **Cloud Firestore** for storing user's, product's and chat data and
- Firebase **Cloud messaging** for push notifications

The app starts with an Authentication screen as shown below
